# Meet-chat-web-app-with-content-filtering
A meet chat application with content moderation is a real-time communication platform that allows users to connect with each other through video, audio and text chat with the additional functionality of meet like screen present, white board with filtering of sensitive content.
MEET-CHAT-WEB-APP-WITH-CONTENT-MODERATION is a messaging app which will provide more functionalities and control to the user that is equipped with content filtering functionality. The main use of this app is to allow users to communicate with each other securely in a single platform and filter out potentially harmful or inappropriate content, making the platform a safer place for communication. The content filtering feature is meant to help and ensure that users can use the app with confidence, knowing that their messages and interactions will be free from offensive or inappropriate material.

It will also reduce the overhead to create and manage the meet link from third party application.

For an instance: The members of a whatsApp/facebook/instagram group can do video call share the chat, but cannot present their screen, do not have white board board, polling option, hand rasing, muting or removing from meet, etc. For that they need to schedule the meet from third party. Also at the time of meet, the admin need to accept the request of each participant to join the meet. Moreover, these links are shareable, so some unknown or unauthorised participant also joins the meet. Which really increases the overhead for admin and reduces the professionalism of the meet.

So by synchronizing the meet and chat functionality at a singly platform will increase the security, professionalism and realibility of the user.
